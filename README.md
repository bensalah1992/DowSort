# DowSort

**Does your MacOS Downloads folder always end up looking like a disaster zone?**  
Don't worry, we've all been there. But now you can fix it in one click! DowSort is a handy little tool that sweeps through your cluttered Downloads folder, sorting everything into neat subfoldersâ€”automatically.

## How It Works

Whenever your Downloads folder is overflowing with photos, videos, documents, and random installers, just run DowSort. With one click, it moves everything to the right place:

- **Photos** go to the "Photos" folder.
- **Videos** find their home in "Videos."
- **Documents** are organized into "Documents."
- **Installers** and **compressed files**? Neatly packed away.

After that, your Downloads folder looks clean again.
