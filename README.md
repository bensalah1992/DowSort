# DowSort

Thank you for downloading **DowSort**! Unfortunately, due to some limitations with macOS, the app isn't immediately executable after downloading. For now, you'll need to run the Python script via the Terminal to organize your Downloads folder.

## How to Run DowSort via Terminal

To run the `dowsort.py` script, follow these steps:

1. **Download and unzip the repository**:
   - You will receive a file named `DowSort-main.zip`.
   - After unzipping it, you'll find a folder called `DowSort-main`.

2. **Open the Terminal**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space` and type **Terminal** to open it.

3. **Navigate to the DowSort directory**:
   In the Terminal, use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you unzipped the files. For example, if it's in the **Downloads** folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/DowSort-main
   ```
   or start directly per Path

   ```bash
   python3 Desktop/DowSort-main/dowsort.py
   ```
   This will organize your Downloads folder into subfolders by file type (Photos, Videos, Documents, etc.).

## Why Isn’t the App Executable?

It’s frustrating not being able to run the app directly. Unfortunately, macOS blocks apps that aren’t from the App Store or signed by a recognized developer.

If you’d like to unblock the app yourself, you can do so through your System Preferences under Security & Privacy. You’ll see an option to “Open Anyway” after attempting to run the app.

I'm working on making this smoother in the future.
